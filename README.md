# 📊 Quantitative Trading with MetaTrader 5

This project provides a modular Python framework for retrieving, storing, and visualizing financial data using the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It focuses on collecting both OHLC and tick-level data from assets listed on the Brazilian stock exchange, enabling users to conduct data-driven trading analysis.

  - Downloading historical OHLC data and tick data for selected tickers.
  - Saving data into organized local directories by asset and timeframe.
  - Slicing datasets for analysis or visualization.

- `testing_class.py`: Example script that demonstrates:
  - Using the `AsimoTrader` class to collect and load financial data.
  - Plotting OHLC time series using Plotly.
  - Exporting interactive HTML charts for further exploration.

- `metatrader_note.ipynb`: A notebook interface showcasing usage examples and additional analysis.
